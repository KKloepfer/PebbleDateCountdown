#PebbleDateCountdown

A Pebble watch face for counting down the number of days until an event.

###Configuration

To configure the watch face, simply open the `config.h` file and change the defined parameters.

You can specify the date, as well as up to two lines of text (`LABEL_ROW_1` and `LABEL_ROW_2`). You can also define your own UUID for the watch face, and easily change between a watch face or watch app type of installation.

###Acknowledgements
Special thanks to [Peter Hardy](http://github.com/phardy) for helping figure out how to get this watch face working and providing sample code, as well as [Whiletrue](http://github.com/Whiletru3) for providing a nice `int` to `char` conversion function that works with Pebble.
